	 * - You have to have a public no-arg constructor to this class.
	 * - The class cannot be nested unless it is static and also public.
	 * - The class must just be public, period, actually.
	 * - The launch() method makes a new instance of this class internally, so it never makes sense to construct an instance of this yourself.
	 * - The launch() method, despite being public and static, can only be called from within a subclass of Application.
	 *    (WHY?!!!?!  So it can reflectively find ITSELF?  Who the fuck designed this thing?!)
	 * So to review: it is never sane to construct this class yourself, but it is also absolutely impossible for me to hide the constructor either.
	 *  Also, I had to make a static method that just calls another static method, just so some stupid reflective bullshit wouldn't bitch about something that's obviously not a problem.
	 * 
	 * Trying to integrate anything with JavaFX is turning out to be more unpleasant than LWJGL.
	 * Which seems a bit ridiculous doesn't it.

	// So how the fuck do I sneak a pointer to anything else into this without using static global fuckups?!
	//   - launch never returns a pointer to the Application instance it makes.
	//   - none of the methods called on the Application by that thread have any other arguments I can control in order to sneak things in.
	//   - what the shit?
	//   - well... I could pass in STRINGS.  That really helps.  Thank god for that.  Stringly typed code is exactly what I want.  That's why I program in java, right?
	// Did seriously no one working on JavaFX ever think that maybe someone someday might want to have some code that comes before the JavaFX thread?
	// Okay, I guess I'll just push shitloads of boilerplate onto library users, cool, great, exactly what I wanted.
