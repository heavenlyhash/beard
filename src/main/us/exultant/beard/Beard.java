	 * <li>the ID of the first Body tag is set to "body"
	 * <li>the ID of the first Head tag is set to "head"

	 * '#body'. (All content should be put here; this makes it harder to screw up and
	 * accidentally overwrite the applet itself!)
	 * <li>if a div called '#dev' doesn't already exist, it is made and added to
	 * '#body'. '#dev' is set to be hidden. (This can be used to log into the browser
	 * DOM, which can be a lot less tiresome than the java control panel.)
	 * <li>finally, attempts to set the focus to '#main'. (Otherwise, the browser
	 * often defaults to giving focus to the applet, which screws immensely with
	 * normal keyboard usage.)
	 * </ul>
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The element '#main' should be used to contain all the rest of the page &mdash;
	 * modifying any elements of the DOM above that can be dangerous, because results
	 * are unpredictable if the applet itself is unlinked from the DOM. The element
	 * '#dev' is intended for use as a debugging output area.
